## Description

Welcome to my project for Emerging Technologies. The goal of this project is to create a web app that recognises hand drawn digits. I have also done some data analysis and exploration in the jupter notebooks so be sure to check those out. For the purposes of making this easy to understand the project will be broken into various parts and I will explain them below

## Sections

### Part 1. 
This is the web app. All code for the web app is in the folder labelled 'MNISTCode'. Everything is there to run the project locally. Also I hope to host this on heroku. ===> Link



### Part 2. 

This is the IRIS dataset. Not necessarily part of the project but it's pretty cool so included it in

### Part 3. 

Initial exploration of the MNIST dataset and training the model

### Part 4. 

Further exploration and explaining how neural networks work and exploring the model in more depth. I didn't want to create a god notebook. 

### Part 5. 

This is a notebook dedicated to the numpy package for python

## Getting Started

To get started just clone this repo or you can use gitpod to load the project in an online virtual enviroment</br>
LINK TO GITPOD =====> https://www.gitpod.io/.

gitpod is really neat and I'd recommne checking this out.

### Prerequisites

Jupyter notebooks =====> https://jupyter.org/ </br>
Anaconda ======> https://www.anaconda.com/ </br>
:warning: You can install jupyter notebooks through anaconda so check out anaconda first!

### How to Run Notebooks
You should have jupyter notebooks installed. Easiest way to do this is to download and run anaconda on your machine that way you can get jupyter notebooks plus a ton of other goodies! Alternatively you can use gitpod and just install the requirments from the command line using

==> insert command to install here



### How to Run Scripts
