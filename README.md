## Description

Welcome to my project for Emerging Technologies. The goal of this project is to create a web app that recognises hand drawn digits. I have also done some data analysis and exploration in the jupter notebooks so be sure to check those out. For the purposes of making this easy to understand the project will be broken into various parts and I will explain them below

## Sections

### Part 1. 
This is the web app. All code for the web app is in the folder labelled 'MNISTCode'. Everything is there to run the project locally. Also I hope to host this on heroku. ===> Link



### Part 2. 

This is the IRIS dataset. Not necessarily part of the project but it's pretty cool so included it in

### Part 3. 

Initial exploration of the MNIST dataset and training the model

### Part 4. 

### Part 5.
